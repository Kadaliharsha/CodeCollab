# CodeCollab

Welcome to **CodeCollab** ‚Äî a collaborative coding platform designed for real-time problem solving, code sharing, and peer learning. CodeCollab enables users to join virtual rooms, tackle coding challenges together, and see live code updates and results, making it ideal for interviews, hackathons, classrooms, and peer programming.

## üöÄ What is CodeCollab?

CodeCollab is an interactive web application that empowers multiple users to collaborate on coding problems in real time. Each room features a shared code editor, live output panel, and problem descriptions, allowing participants to write, execute, and submit code together. Submissions are automatically judged against test cases for instant feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Flask, SQLAlchemy): Backend API, room management, user authentication, and code execution logic.
- **HTML & Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive UI for the code editor and rooms.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication between clients for instant code updates and room events.
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent database for users, rooms, problems, and test cases.
- **Docker** (suggested): Isolated code execution environment (extensible for interview safety).
- **JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity and WebSocket event handling.
